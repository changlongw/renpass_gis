Model description
=============

renpassG!S is an easy-to-use application designed to model energy systems, which is developed and maintained at the Center for Sustainable Energy Systems (Zentrum f√ºr nachhaltige Energysysteme (ZNES)) in Flensburg.
The application is closely linked to the Open-Energy-Modeling-Framework (oemof).
Making use of the broad functionality of oemof, the application renpassG!S provides easy-to-understand energy system scenarios for Europe in a CSV format,
optimizing the power plant dispatch for minimum cost and exports results of the optimization process.

Installation
=============

pip install -r requirements.txt

In addition an algorithm solving optimization problems has to be installed, for
example the glpk - solver as provided by the GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit).
