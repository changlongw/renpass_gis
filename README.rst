The application renpassG!S stands for (r)enewable (en)ergy (pa)thway (s)imulation (s)ystem capable of working with (GIS) data.
It is based on the original idea of the model _renpass and closely linked to the Open Energy Modelling Framework (_oemof).

This documentation is meant to explain the basic functionality and structured as follows:

Overview
=============

renpassG!S is an easy-to-use application designed to model energy systems, which is developed and maintained at the Center for Sustainable Energy Systems (Zentrum f√ºr nachhaltige Energysysteme (ZNES)) in Flensburg.
The application is closely linked to the Open-Energy-Modeling-Framework (oemof).
Making use of the broad functionality of oemof, the application renpassG!S provides easy-to-understand energy system scenarios for different regions in a CSV format, optimizing the power plant dispatch at minimum cost.
All results are exported into a CSV structure as well an can be easily accessed using spreadsheet software such as LibreOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel.

The general functionality can be derived from the following figure:
